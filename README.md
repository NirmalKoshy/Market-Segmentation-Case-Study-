## Project Overview
This project is a collaborative effort aimed at analyzing and segmenting McDonald's customer base. We utilized various advanced data techniques to uncover different customer segments and provide actionable insights to help McDonald's tailor its marketing strategies more effectively.

What We Did:
Data Collection: We gathered high-quality data that included customer behaviors, preferences, and demographics.

Data Exploration: Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we cleaned and prepared the data for segmentation by checking for errors and inconsistencies. We also standardized the data to ensure accuracy in our analysis.

Segmentation Techniques: We applied clustering techniques like K-means and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to identify distinct customer segments. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) helped us reduce dimensionality and visualize the segments more clearly.

Profiling and Describing Segments: Once the segments were identified, we created detailed profiles of each group. This included analyzing key attributes like customer preferences (e.g., whether they see McDonald's as affordable, tasty, etc.).

Targeting and Strategy Recommendations: Based on our analysis, we proposed specific marketing strategies for the most promising segments. For example, one idea was a budget-friendly product line to attract younger customers who find McDonald's food tasty but expensive.
